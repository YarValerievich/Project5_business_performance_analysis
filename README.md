# Research of user data and acquisition costs, as well as analysis of advertising profitability, LTV, CAC, and ROI

I recommend checking out the project at the [following link](https://nbviewer.org/github/YarValerievich/Project5_business_performance_analysis/blob/main/business_performance_analysis.ipynb).

## Purpose: 

It is necessary to figure out the reasons for the losses and help the company to turn a profit.

## Description: 

At the moment, we can conclude that investing in "TipTop" channel is not effective. Its CAC is almost three times higher than the next channel "FaceBoom" (2.8 vs 1.1), while the latter has almost double the percentage of paying customers (12.2% for "FaceBoom" vs 9.6% for "TipTop").

## Result:

It is strongly recommended to reallocate the funds invested in the development of the application in the American and European market, because the current budget shares amount to 66% and 33%, respectively.

It is worth considering the allocation of the budget invested in American channels "TipTop" and "FaceBoom" in favor of "YRabbit," "MediaTornado," and "RocketSuperAds" as the advertising in the former does not pay off.

"YRabbit" - ROI is 2.6
"MediaTornado" - ROI is 2.5
"RocketSuperAds" - ROI is 2.2

In Europe, it is recommended to choose "lambdaMediaAds" since its customers' LTV is significantly higher than the others, while ROI approaches the 2.5 mark, and "LeapBob," since the cost of acquiring a new user in this channel is significantly lower than the others, and the ROI is approximately 2.3.

It is also recommended to develop the application in the European market, as the cost of acquiring new users in these countries is 4 times lower than in the United States.
